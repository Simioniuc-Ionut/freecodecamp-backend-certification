  - Extracting client information from request headers (IP, language, software)

- **Exercise Tracker:**  
  - Managing users and exercise logs in memory
  - Filtering and limiting results with query parameters

- **Timestamp Microservice:**  
  - Parsing and validating dates from URL parameters
  - Returning Unix and UTC formats

- **Swagger Documentation:**  
  - Auto-generating API docs with Swagger JSDoc and Swagger UI

- **MongoDB & Mongoose:**  
  - Connecting to MongoDB Atlas

## Projects Included

- **Timestamp Microservice**
- **Header Parser Microservice**
- **URL Shortener Microservice**
- **Exercise Tracker**
- **File Metadata Microservice**
- **MongoDB & Mongoose Challenges**

Each project is in its own folder and can be run independently.

## Deployment

All projects were also deployed and tested using [Replit](https://replit.com/@simioniucionut), allowing public API access and automated FreeCodeCamp testing.
